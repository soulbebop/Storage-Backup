## Storage > Backup > Overview

Backup is a service that makes copies and keeps them safely to prepare for data loss due to security threats, user's operational mistakes, storage device failure, natural disasters, and so on. You can also restore data using the backup copy.

NHN Cloud Backup service uses both full and incremental backup methods. Initially, the service performs backup of all data in the path registered by the user. Afterwards, only incremental backups are performed using variable-length deduplication technology, which can minimize backup data by removing duplicates. This shortens backup times and reduces network usage. Data is encrypted and transferred securely to backup storage.

NHN Cloud Backup service provides a web console environment where you can easily register backup policies, view backup history, and request restoration. Backup results are collected daily and reported to the user's email.

## Service Features
* Supports various operating systems.
* Optimized for virtualization environment.
* Performs backup without interrupting the service.
* Provides a user-defined backup policy that allows you to set the backup cycle, backup time, and retention cycle.

### Backup Cycle
You can choose between 1-day interval and 7-day interval.

### Backup Time
You can select a backup start time by the hour. It is recommended to select the time when the number of file change is minimal and the server is idle. Actual backup start time may vary by up to 1 hour, depending on the situation.

### Retention Cycle
You can select a retention cycle of 7 days, 14 days, 21 days, 30 days, 6 months (180 days), 1 year (365 days), 3 years (1095 days), or 5 years (1825 days).

### View Results
Users can view backup results on the web console within 30 minutes from the backup completion time. If the backup fails, the details of failure are reported to the user's email. If the backup is not performed up to 3 hours, it is logged as a failure.

1. Select a server to restore.
2. Click **Apply for Restoration** in the **Restoration** tab.
3. Fill in the content and click **Apply**.
